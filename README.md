#Eduardo Hoppensted Personal Website
##Portfolio and main profesional experience

This project is the design of my personal site landing page.
It is only a static site, currently no JavaScript has been added, I took advantage of Medium and Social media (Twitter, GH, LinkedIn) to add links.

The site is currently only designed for desktop, relies mostly on Flexbox for visualization and needs improvement in several areas.
